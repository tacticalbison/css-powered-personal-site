        <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          I have worked with a variety of coding languages throughout my life and have gained invaluable experience with
          solving problems in my past career.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a career pivot, I completed a bootcamp (Fullstack Academy). During this experience, I learned that
          absorb new information quickly and am able to teach that new knowledge to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently my tech stack is Node.js centered, using React.js and Redux.js on the front end. My backend stack is
          centered around Express/SQL. I actively seek out new learning opportunities and am constantly improving.

          alt="icon consisting of two outlined hands grasping each other in a shaking hands gesture, in front of three outlined non-gendered people, in front of an outline of a sprocket gear" />
        <h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the immersive bootcamp experience, I worked within teams to design two very different applications.
          I learned that I enjoy taking ownership of the code I work on and helping to define the priorities of the
          codebase goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a field engineer for 13 years, I spent much of my time within teams to complete the same goals and achieve
          timely results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for quickly learning new technologies and later training technicians on the
          same technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also served as a primary point of contact for technical questions throughout my
          department. Oftentimes, I served as the final point of contact prior to communication with clients.
