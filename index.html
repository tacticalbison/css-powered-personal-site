          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked with a variety of coding languages in high school and
            throughout college while I pursued my engineering degree. During a
            career pivot, I completed a bootcamp (Fullstack Academy) and
            immersed myself into fullstack coding strategies.

            alt="icon consisting of two outlined hands grasping each other in a shaking hands gesture, in front of three outlined non-gendered people, in front of an outline of a sprocket gear"
          />
          <h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the immersive bootcamp experience, I worked within teams
            to design two very different applications. I learned that I enjoy
            taking ownership of the code I work on and helping to define the
            priorities of the codebase goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a field engineer for 13 years, I spent much of my time within
            teams to complete the same goals and achieve timely results.
