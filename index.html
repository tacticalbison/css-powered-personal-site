          <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked with a variety of coding languages in high school and
            college while I pursued my engineering degree.
          </p>
          <p>
              During a career pivot, I completed a bootcamp (Fullstack Academy). During this experience, I learned that I am capable of learning new technologies and new coding strategies quickly and am able to teach what I learn to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently my tech stack is node.js centered, with React.js and Redux.js on the front end,  and backend experience with Express/SQL. I am adding new strategies as I redesign my portfolio!

            alt="icon consisting of two outlined hands grasping each other in a shaking hands gesture, in front of three outlined non-gendered people, in front of an outline of a sprocket gear"
          />
          <h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the immersive bootcamp experience, I worked within teams
            to design two very different applications. I learned that I enjoy
            taking ownership of the code I work on and helping to define the
            priorities of the codebase goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a field engineer for 13 years, I spent much of my time within
            teams to complete the same goals and achieve timely results.
